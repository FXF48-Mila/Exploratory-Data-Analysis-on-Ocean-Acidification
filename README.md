# Ocean Acidification
This is the OCEAN215 final project from Liuyixin Shao. It's written in google Colab. Among them, the `Copy of Copy of Final.ipynb` is the code for the final analysis, the `Ocean 215 final slide.pptx` is the slides with the final analysis of my data, and the `final_project_data.csv` is the data I used for the analysis.
