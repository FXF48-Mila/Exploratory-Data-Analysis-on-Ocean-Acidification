# Ocean Acidification

## A note:
This is the OCEAN215 final project from Liuyixin Shao. It's written in google Colab. Among them, the `Copy of Copy of Final.ipynb` is the code for the final analysis, the `Ocean 215 final slide.pptx` is the slides with the final analysis of my data, and the `final_project_data.csv` is the data I used for the analysis.

## Introduction:
Ocean acidification is the reduction in the pH value of the Earth’s ocean. The cause of ocean acidification is clear: carbon pollution released by burning fossil fuels, making oceans absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere and format more carbonic acid. 

Yet, the seawater is still alkaline, with a pH around 8.1. However, the lowered pH damage calcium-based shells and skeletons from marine calcifying organisms, like mollusks, oysters and corals.

## Data
Coastal Ocean Data Analysis Product in North America (CODAP-NA, Version 2021) (NCEI Accession 0219960)

This version of the CODAP-NA is composed of 3,391 oceanographic profiles from 61 research cruises covering all continental shelves in North America (U.S. west coast, U.S. east coast, Gulf of Mexico, and Alaska coast). It has 28,206 rows and contains the data from  2003-12-05 to 2018-11-22.

For more information about the dataset: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/oceans/ncei/ocads/metadata/0219960.html

One limitation of my data is the lack of deep-water sampling (>1500m.

## The main research questions for this project:
 - Has the pH of seawater on the west coast shown a great decline in recent years？
 - What are the general trends in pH changes in seawater near the coast？
